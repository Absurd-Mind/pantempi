===== pantempi =====

pantempi is a temperature and humidity sensor board based on the panStamp
wireless sensor nodes.


==== git submodule configuration ====

This repository uses external repostiories using git submodules:

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update


==== Hardware Assembly ====

Each panStamp needs an antenna. A simple wire stub should do. The default
frequency is 868 MHz, but they can also operate on 915 MHz if you chose so
later on.

                 |  868 MHz | 915 MHz  |
  ---------------+----------+----------+
  1/4 Wavelength |  82.2 mm |  77.9 mm |
  1/2 Wavelength | 164.3 mm | 155.9 mm |

In experiments it seems like that these do not have to be very exact on short
distance, so any wirelength around 8 cm should do.

==== Software Requirements ====

* Arduino panstamp library

This is required for the pantempi firmware. Import library with the help of the
Arduino IDE or simply place the panstamp folder in this ZIP file into the
.../arduino/libraries/ directory (detailed installation instructions can be
found at http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).

* Arduino Timer1 library

This is required for the modem firmware. See instructins above.

* panStamp Python applications

Extract these to any directory for later use.
